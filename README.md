### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kostas.

I am a [full stack software engineer](https://cv.kostas.rocks) from a beautiful town in Crete, currently living in London. 

I love creating Web, Desktop, Mobile, CLI and IOT apps, mainly using JavaScript/TypeScript and the React/GraphQL/Node.js ecosystem. 

I am director and lead engineer of [Oranger LTD](https://oranger.co.uk), a London-based IT consultancy studio.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me to discuss a project, an idea or technology, science (especially astronomy) and why not philosophy.
